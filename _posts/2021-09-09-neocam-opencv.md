Caleta Team and NeoCam Project
====

During the past few months I, along with seven colleagues from UCA Datalab, have been participating in the first OpenCV AI Competition. Our team, named Caleta, proposed the project "NeoCam: Real time telemonitoring of preterm neonates". NeoCam project uses the Luxonis OAK-D smart camera to build a contactless monitoring system for newborn babies. Computer vision, Machine Learning, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing and Internet of Things are some of the technologies that we have combined into the proposed solution. 

The NeoCam system is able to monitor pain and emotional stress, breathing rhythm, physical activity and sleep-wake cycles purely using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, some of which have been developed specifically for this project.

Images are processed by Deep Learning models inside the OAK-D camera, output data sent to a centralized IoT server and consumed by a mobile app. This app is able to show aggregated reports on the evolution of the baby with 24-7 surveillance and it raises alerts in case anomalous events are detected. Different viewing profiles are available for parents/relatives or healthcare personnel.

The ability to automate baby monitoring in NICUs (Newborn Intensive Care Units) opens new ways to assess psycho-motor cognitive development and help healthcare professionals in saturated work environments. Although still in a very premature phase, constant smart monitoring of breathing rate might raise alerts that help reduce the number of sudden infant deaths. We have built a prototype of the NeoCam device at the University of CÃ¡diz.

Check out these cool videos explaining the project:

The OpenCV AI Competition
====

OpenCV AI competition is focused on solutions solving real world problems using spatial AI. Teams use the new OpenCV AI Kit D (OAK-D) to solve their challenge areas. The OAK-D is a smart camera with neural inference and depth processing capability on board.

The first phase of the competition involved a description of the project idea. Over 1400 submissions from more than a hundred different countries were sent. This first phase ended on March 3rd, and only 257 projects were selected and became finalist. All of the selected teams received 10 OAK-D devices, and had four months to develop their projects. Our team, Caleta, was one of these selected few.

On September 6th, NeoCam project was announced to be one of the 19 Regional Prize winners. In particular, we earned 1st place in the Europe + Russia + Australasia region! Today, I am glad to announce that NeoCam also earned 2nd place in the World Finale!
