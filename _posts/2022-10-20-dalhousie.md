Hello dear readers,

During my PhD at Cadiz University, I had the fantastic opportunity to intern at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) in Canada. Invited by [Professor Robert Milson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-7866), I focused on weather routing and the [Zermelo's Navigation Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%27s_navigation_problem).

My internship from July to October 2022 was a mix of intensive research and cultural exploration. A highlight was attending the ["Symmetry, Invariants, and their Applications"](https://www.math.mun.ca/~movingframes2022/) conference, where I interacted with leading experts and explored cutting-edge mathematical research.

Beyond work, I enjoyed Nova Scotiaâ€™s natural beauty, including a memorable hike in Herring Cove near Halifax with conference participants.

I'm grateful to Professor Milson and Dalhousie University for this enriching experience. It broadened my research perspective, introduced me to new cultures, and forged lasting connections.

All the best,
Daniel Precioso
