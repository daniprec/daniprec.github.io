As a PhD student in Data Science at Cadiz University, I had the opportunity to participate in an internship at Dalhousie University in Canada. I was invited there by [Professor Robert Milson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-7866) of the Mathematics Department to work on my research project in the field of weather routing, specifically solving the [Zermelo's Navigation Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%27s_navigation_problem).

My internship lasted from July to October 2022, and it was an incredible experience. I learned a lot about my research field, but also about Canadian culture and the academic environment at Dalhousie University. One of the highlights of my internship was participating in the Conference ["Symmetry, Invariants, and their Applications"](https://www.math.mun.ca/~movingframes2022/). During the conference, I had the opportunity to meet many experts in Mathematics and learned a lot about the latest research trends and advances in the area.

But it wasn't all work and no play! I had the chance to explore the beautiful province of Nova Scotia and discover its natural wonders. One of such memorable experiences was taking the conference participants on a hiking tour in Herring Cove. The cove is located near Halifax and is known for its scenic beauty and rich marine life. It was an incredible experience to share with my colleagues and new friends.

Overall, my internship at Dalhousie University was an amazing experience that taught me a lot about my research field, exposed me to new cultures, and allowed me to make lifelong connections with people from around the world. I am grateful to Professor Milson and the team at Dalhousie University for giving me this opportunity, and I am excited to apply what I have learned to my future research endeavors.
