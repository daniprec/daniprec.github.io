Last week I had the pleasure of participating in the workshop **New Bridges between Mathematics and Data Science**, held from November 8 to 11 at the **Conde Ansúrez Conference Center** in Valladolid. The event was organized by **IMUva** (Instituto de Matemáticas de la Universidad de Valladolid) and the **Red Estratégica de Matemáticas (REM)**, with the goal of fostering new collaborations between mathematical sciences and the growing field of data science.

I gave a talk on **Smart Shipping**, the maritime route optimization tool we've been developing at [**UCA Datalab**](https://datalab.uca.es). My presentation focused on how we use machine learning and environmental data (like wind, waves, and ocean currents) to compute more efficient and sustainable paths for ships, reducing both emissions and fuel consumption.

It was a fantastic opportunity to discuss mathematical models in an applied context, and to hear from colleagues working at the intersection of theory and impact. A big thanks to the organizers for hosting such a stimulating event. And a special shoutout to **Javier Jiménez** and **Manuel Navarro** for making the trip and the workshop all the more enjoyable.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
