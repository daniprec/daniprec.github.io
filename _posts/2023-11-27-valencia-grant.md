Hello dear readers,

I'm thrilled to share that **Green Navigation**, our weather-routing project for maritime decarbonization, has been awarded **€93,000 in funding** by **Missions València 2030**! This initiative is part of the city's ambitious strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in the coming years, contributing to the European Union's broader climate neutrality goals by 2050.

As project lead, I had the opportunity to **present Green Navigation directly to the jury**, where I explained our vision for reducing emissions from commercial shipping through algorithmic route optimization. I'm proud to share that our project was **ranked top by the jury**, earning first-place recognition and full funding support.

Green Navigation helps cargo ships reduce fuel use and emissions by optimizing routes based on real-time weather and oceanographic data. On average, vessels using our system save up to **6% in fuel**, which, at scale, could lead to **over 4.5 million tons of CO₂ saved annually** — just in the Port of València alone.

This grant will allow us to further develop and scale our system, and it's a testament to the growing recognition of data science as a tool for environmental impact. It also reflects the outstanding support we've received from the **Opentop acceleration program**, which continues to foster innovation within the Port of València.

Many thanks to **Chema Leal**, who represented our startup at the award ceremony, and to the entire Missions València team for believing in our mission.
