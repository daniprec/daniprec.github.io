Hello dear readers,

Big day yesterday: I had the privilege of participating for the third time in the **Steering Committee** meeting of the **IE Insurance and Tech Lab**, our research initiative with Vienna Insurance Group (VIG) on climate change and life insurance.

The goal of the meeting was to review the progress of our research project, "Climate Change Effects on Life & Health Insurance", and to align on the next steps. I had a great discussion with VIG's leadership team, including their Head of Group Development and Strategy, and also with our academic partners from IE University.

I presented our latest findings on how climate change is impacting mortality rates and health outcomes. Then we brainstormed strategies for insurers to adapt their products and pricing models. It was a very productive session, and I am excited about the next phase of our research.

By the way: there is a conference happening at IE University next September, where we will share our results with the broader insurance community. Stay tuned for more details!

The afternoon was dedicated to a technical meeting with the VIG team, where we went deeper into the data analysis and modeling techniques we are using. It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas and ensure that our research stays aligned with the practical needs of the insurance industry.

We finished the day with a more casual dinner, where we had the chance to connect on a more personal level and discuss future collaborations. I am grateful for the opportunity to work with such a forward-thinking company, and to contribute to research that can have a real impact on how the insurance industry responds to climate change.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso, PhD
