Hello dear readers,

I received my first Teaching Excellence Award at IE University!

<p align="center"><img src="{{ page.featured_image }}" width="80%"/></p>

I am genuinely grateful to my students for this recognition. Teaching data science and programming is a lot like debugging: sometimes chaotic, often humbling, but always worth it when something finally "clicks".

Thank you, IE School of Science and Technology, for creating an environment where learning goes both ways. I'm looking forward to keeping this growth trend strictly positive!

All the best,

Daniel Precioso, PhD
