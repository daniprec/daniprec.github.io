Hello dear readers,

I hope the last trimester of the year is treating you well! Mine has been quite busy, between [researching data science at IE](https://www.ie.edu/ieresearchdatalab/), teaching computer programming, and [managing my startup](https://greenavigation.com/). Additionally, this week I was invited to visit Dubai to present my weather routing project, "Green Navigation", at Prototypes for Humanity 2024. This prestigious event showcases innovative solutions with the power to achieve a better future. The Prototypes for Humanity programme supports high-potential technological innovations emerging from the academic world.

Over 2000 solutions were submitted to Prototypes for Humanity 2024, and only 100 of them were chosen. Being selected to present in Dubai is a major milestone for my weather routing project. The event took place at the Dubai Emirates Towers, where I presented our research to a large audience of professionals and researchers from around the world. This exposure has opened up exciting opportunities for collaboration and further advancements for Green Navigation.

My research team is developing state-of-the-art algorithms for weather routing in maritime transport. We optimize maritime routes by taking into account real-time oceanographic and meteorological data, achieving savings of 10% without incurring any retrofitting costs. This weather routing research will help reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and costs, while also improving safety and efficiency in maritime transport.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso, PhD
