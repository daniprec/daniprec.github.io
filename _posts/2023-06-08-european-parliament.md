Hello dear readers,

I'm still buzzing from my incredible experience presenting at the European Parliament with [Canonical Green](https://canonicalgreen.com)! It was a momentous occasion that I'll cherish forever.

During my pitch, I introduced [Green Navigation](https://greenavigation.com/), our innovative solution designed to revolutionize the shipping industry by significantly reducing its carbon footprint.

I started by highlighting a staggering fact: the shipping industry releases 30 tons of CO2 every second. This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need for effective solutions.

Green Navigation is a data-driven tool that helps shipping companies cut emissions by at least 2% while enhancing safety. It’s affordable, accessible, and ready to implement with just a computer and Internet access.

As a co-founder of Canonical Green, I also advocated for funding to accelerate development and improve our tool’s reliability. Collaboration with the broader shipping industry is key to achieving a sustainable future.

A huge thank you to my amazing team: David Gómez-Ullate Oteiza and Javier Jiménez de la Jara. I wanna thank too Antonio Alvarez Ramirez, Nerea Quintana Vilavert, Salvador Morón Curt, and Tomasz Aleksander Miś—for for their invaluable support as fellow participants of The Arch. And a special shoutout to [The Arch](https://www.the-arch.eu/en/) for making this opportunity possible.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
