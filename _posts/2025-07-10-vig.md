Hello dear readers,

I hope you're having a restful and inspiring summer! I'm very excited to share a new chapter in my research journey. Last week, *IE University* and *Vienna Insurance Group (VIG)* officially launched the **IE Insurance and Tech Lab**, a global research initiative to tackle the major challenges at the intersection of insurance, emerging technologies, and climate change.

The Lab was inaugurated on July 10 at IE's Madrid campus, bringing together academic leaders and industry partners. It's an initiative of the [IE Impact Xcelerator](https://ixlabs.ie.edu/), our strategic platform to advance science and tech-based solutions for sectors like health, finance, energy, and the environment.

The lab's first research focus is on **"Climate Change Effects on Life & Health Insurance"**, and I'm proud to be leading this project alongside Vice Dean [David GÃ³mez-Ullate](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/david-gomez-ullate/). We are bringing together data science, climate modeling, and actuarial methods to rethink risk modeling in a warming world.

This work aligns closely with my broader research interests in building resilient systems through intelligent data-driven tools. Whether it's weather routing for ships or climate-aware insurance models, I believe the future of sustainability will be powered by interdisciplinary collaboration and smart technology.

I'm grateful to be part of this ambitious initiative, and I look forward to sharing insights and progress with you as the project develops.

All the best,
