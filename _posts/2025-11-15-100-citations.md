A short note to say: thank you. I have reached 100 citations!

When I started my journey in applied data science I always prioritised practical impact over bibliometrics. Still, seeing my work reach 100 citations is a deeply rewarding milestone: a sign that solution-driven research shapes conversations and decisions beyond the lab.

I am grateful to my mentor, David Gómez-Ullate Oteiza, to my co-authors and collaborators, and to the IE School of Science and Technology, "where minds collide and impact happens". This milestone belongs to every student, partner, and reviewer who helped sharpen the ideas behind the work.

Onward: more impact to build, more problems to solve. Thanks for a 100 times.
