Hello dear readers,

I recently had the pleasure of being interviewed by [Opentop](https://opentop.es/) for their First Startup Acceleration Program. In this interview, I discussed [Canonical Green](http://canonicalgreen.com)'s innovative approach to reducing carbon footprints, especially in partnership with [Boluda Corporación Marítima](https://www.boluda.com.es/es/inicio/).

Canonical Green, a team from the [University of Cadiz](https://www.uca.es/), is dedicated to driving the green transition through data science. Our flagship solution, [Green Navigation](https://greenavigation.com/), acts like an eco-friendly GPS for maritime routes, optimizing for speed, safety, and environmental impact.

Working with Opentop has been transformative, offering tailored support and invaluable insights into the maritime industry's needs. Our collaboration with [Fundación Valenciaport](https://www.fundacion.valenciaport.com/) and engagement with mentors have enriched our entrepreneurial journey.

For more on the interview and how Canonical Green is leading the charge towards greener seas, check out the full interview [here](https://opentop.es/2023/05/16/canonical-green-low-risk-carbon-footprint-reduction/).

Thank you for following along, and stay tuned for more updates!
