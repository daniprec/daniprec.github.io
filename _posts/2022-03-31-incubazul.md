We're excited to share that **Smart Shipping** has been officially selected to join [**IncubAzul**](https://www.incubazul.es/), the high-technology **Blue Economy incubator** developed by the Cádiz Free Trade Zone and co-financed by **EU FEDER funds**.

Our project was one of six startups chosen in this first intake, alongside initiatives working on sustainable tourism, architectural design, and circular economy solutions. Following a competitive evaluation process, we're proud to see our proposal, focused on maritime route optimization and fuel reduction, recognized as a valuable contribution to the sustainable transformation of the maritime sector.

Our work at [**UCA Datalab**](https://datalab.uca.es) aims to support cleaner, more efficient navigation using environmental data and algorithmic optimization. IncubAzul will give us access to personalized mentoring through **Telefónica Open Innovation**, along with legal, financial, and business development support to help us grow beyond the research phase and into real-world impact.

The program officially kicks off on **April 5th**, and we're eager to begin this next chapter alongside a community of ocean-minded innovators. A big thanks to the entire IncubAzul team and evaluation committee for their trust, and to my team leads **David Gómez-Ullate**, **Javier Jiménez**, **Francisco Amor**, and everyone who's made Smart Shipping possible.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
