This week I had the opportunity to present my ongoing PhD research at the **JIPII 2021 Doctoral Consortium**, a gathering hosted by the Universidad de Cádiz to share the latest advances across doctoral projects in Computer Science.

My talk focused on the [**Sustainable Fishing project**](https://rodin.uca.es/bitstream/handle/10498/26026/Actas_JIPIII2021.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=22), where we apply machine learning to estimate fish abundance in the ocean using satellite-derived environmental data. The idea is simple in theory: bring together marine science and AI to build models that can help monitor ecosystems, guide regulation, and promote more sustainable fishing practices. In practice, it means wrangling chlorophyll maps, vessel tracks, and more than a few interpolation headaches.

Participating in JIPII was a great opportunity to exchange feedback and see how peers are using data science in everything from neonatal care to smart mobility. As for me, it's always rewarding to contribute to conversations at the intersection of **AI and sustainability**, and to share how ocean data can be leveraged for positive impact.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
