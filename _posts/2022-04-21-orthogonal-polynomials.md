This week, I had the privilege of helping organize the **International Conference on Orthogonal Polynomials**, held at the Universidad de Cádiz from April 21–23, 2022. The event was co-hosted by [**UCA Datalab**](https://datalab.uca.es) and **Universidad Carlos III de Madrid**, and brought together over fifty researchers from Europe, the Americas, and beyond.

This year's edition was especially meaningful: it celebrated the **70th birthday of Francisco Marcellán**, a leading figure in the field and a cornerstone of the mathematical community in Spain. The program included talks on approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials, integrable systems, and operator theory—many of the topics shaped by Marcellán's career and mentorship.

As part of the organizing team, it was a joy to see the return of in-person international collaboration after two years of remote interaction. The event was **led by David Gómez-Ullate**, with support from **Javier Jiménez**, **Francisco Amor**, and **Praduman Goyal**. Seeing so many colleagues reconnect, share research, and honor a respected scholar made for a truly memorable experience.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
