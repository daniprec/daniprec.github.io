Hello dear readers,

Today I want to share my experience at the ["Environmental Monitoring: An Exploratory Workshop"](https://wimoboproject.com/index.php/event/) held at the [Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences (RAC)](https://rac.es/) in Madrid. It was an honor to attend this event and hear a keynote from [David Gómez-Ullate](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/david-gomez-ullate/), who highlighted the role of meteorology in addressing ecological challenges in maritime transportation.

During the workshop, I presented our Hybrid Search (HS) algorithm for weather routing. This innovative approach addresses Zermelo's Navigation Problem by combining optimal path search methods with variational refinement, showing how mathematics can enhance navigation and support the ecological transition.

The workshop also featured insightful talks from:
- [José Enrique Gutiérrez](https://personas.upct.es/perfil/jose.gutierrez) on machine learning for ship performance.
- [Fernando Cañavate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-ca%C3%B1avate-vega-17b253a) on Hamiltonian neural networks.
- My colleague [Rafael Ballester-Ripoll](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/rafael-ballester-ripoll/) on weather routing with evolutionary algorithms and Bézier curves.

I’m grateful to [David Martin de Diego](https://www.csic.es/en/node/1361297) and [Alexandre Anahory](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/alexandre-anahory/) for the invitation, and to the RAC and [Wimobo](https://wimoboproject.com/) for hosting this valuable event. Special thanks to the [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) for their support and to everyone who made the workshop memorable.

Looking forward to more innovative contributions to the blue economy!
