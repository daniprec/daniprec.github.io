Hello dear readers,

I hope your January has been as rewarding as mine. I recently completed my tenure as a Computer Programming professor at [BAM](https://www.ie.edu/university/studies/academic-programs/bachelor-applied-mathematics/), and I already miss the students!

Today, I want to share a highlight from my time at BAM: guiding students through a Python project to generate specific types of matrices based on complex algebraic rules. This project wasn't just about coding, it was a deep dive into matrix algebra and practical programming.

What made this project stand out was using Chat-GPT. Instead of simplifying the task, Chat-GPT's limited understanding of advanced algebra required students to critically analyze and guide its output. They needed to fine tune those prompt engineering skills! This challenge improved their understanding of both programming and algebra.

The project's success exceeded my expectations: IE University's news outlet featured an article on this project. This recognition underscores the value of innovative teaching methods in education.

For more on the project's technical details and student experiences, read the full interview [here](https://www.ie.edu/school-science-technology/news/students-in-the-bachelor-of-applied-mathematics-test-chatgpts/).
