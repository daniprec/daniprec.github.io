Hello dear readers,

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve officially started a post-doctoral position at IE University! This new chapter allows me to dive deeper into my passion for Machine Learning, Data Science, and the Blue Economy, focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

A huge thanks to Fundación BBVA and IE School of Science and Technology for this opportunity. The research here is not just academic; it's about making real-world impacts. Plus, I’m excited to teach Computer Programming in the new Bachelor of Applied Mathematics program. Engaging with students in this new role is something I’m really looking forward to!

Reflecting on my journey from Universidad de Cádiz to now, I’m grateful for the experiences that have led me here. The support from my fellow research peers and industry experts has been invaluable.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting adventure!
