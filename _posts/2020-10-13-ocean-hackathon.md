This past weekend, I had the chance to participate in the [**Ocean Hackathon 2020**](https://www.zonafrancacadiz.com/los-57-investigadores-ya-trabajan-en-los-nueve-retos-para-salvar-los-oceanos/) in Cádiz alongside my colleagues from **UCA Datalab**. Our team joined the challenge titled *"Route optimization for vessels in the ocean"*, with the goal of reducing fuel consumption and travel time by designing ship routes that take advantage of real-time ocean currents.

With less than 48 hours on the clock, we developed a complete pipeline: processing raw current data, applying a **genetic algorithm** to search for optimal paths, and deploying a simple **web interface** to visualize the solutions. The combination of **machine learning**, **marine data**, and a bit of sleep deprivation paid off: our project was awarded **third place**, just two points shy of the runner-up.

This hackathon experience was more than just a competition. It was a hands-on opportunity to apply AI to ocean sustainability, working shoulder-to-shoulder with researchers and developers passionate about innovation at sea. For us at UCA Datalab, this recognition is a small but meaningful step toward smarter, greener maritime solutions, and hopefully the first of many!

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
