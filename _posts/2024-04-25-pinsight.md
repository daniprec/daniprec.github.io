Hello dear readers,

I hope spring is bringing you new ideas and energy. I'm writing to share a quick update from Halifax, Canada, where I had the pleasure of returning to [The PIER](https://thepierhfx.com/), one of the world's most vibrant innovation hubs in maritime logistics.

This visit was part of the **PINsight event**, co-hosted by The PIER and [Opentop](https://opentop.es/), the port innovation accelerator at the Port of Valencia, where Green Navigation is currently enrolled. The event brought together members of the **Port Innovators Network (PIN)**, a global consortium of forward-looking ports and innovation centers. The goal? To connect, share, and strengthen our collective ability to innovate in the maritime domain.

At the session, I had the opportunity to speak about **Green Navigation**, our platform that acts like a Google Maps for the sea. By integrating marine weather forecasts and oceanographic data, we help shipping companies choose safer, greener, and more efficient routes. I gave a talk titled *"How data is optimizing shipping"*, where I presented how real-time environmental data and AI-powered algorithms are helping us reduce emissions, fuel use, and voyage risksâ€”without needing any retrofitting.

This was Green Navigation's **second visit to The PIER**, a special place where innovation and impact go hand in hand. If you'd like to revisit our first experience here, you can check out this earlier post: [First visit to The PIER](https://greenavigation.com/2023-halifax/).

All the best,
