Hello dear readers,

I recently attended the [61st Congress of Naval Engineering and Maritime Industry](https://61congreso.ingenierosnavales.com/) in Palma de Mallorca, where I explored cutting-edge advancements in maritime energy efficiency and propulsion technologies.

Networking with industry professionals and fellow students was inspiring. The congress highlighted the potential of modern sail technologies like WINGSAIL and eSAIL, which promise to boost ship speeds using wind power—a major leap towards sustainability.

Discussions on "slow steaming" and other methods to reduce emissions while maintaining delivery schedules were particularly engaging. 

Thank you to the Asociación de Ingenieros Navales y Oceánicos de España for organizing this insightful event. I am excited to see how these innovations will shape the future of maritime transportation and am eager to contribute to this progress.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
