I recently had the pleasure of attending the [61st Congress of Naval Engineering and Maritime Industry](https://61congreso.ingenierosnavales.com/) in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. As a PhD student specializing in data science and weather routing, I was excited to learn about the latest advancements in energy efficiency and propulsion technologies for the maritime industry.

During the congress, I had the opportunity to network with industry professionals and meet several naval engineering students who shared my passion for the industry's sustainable future. It was inspiring to see the progress being made towards the green transition of the maritime industry!

One of the most exciting topics discussed at the congress was the potential of modern sail technologies such as WINGSAIL and eSAIL, which can significantly increase a ship's speed through the proper utilization of wind. This is a game-changer for the industry, and I am excited to see how it will continue to evolve in the coming years.

The insights into the application of wind power in improving the energy efficiency of maritime transportation were valuable and thought-provoking. The discussions surrounding the use of "slow steaming" to reduce emissions while maintaining delivery schedules also sparked interesting debates on finding sustainable solutions for the industry.

In conclusion, the 61st Congress of Naval Engineering and Maritime Industry was an enriching experience, and I am grateful to the Asociación de Ingenieros Navales y Oceánicos de España for organizing such a powerful event. I am excited to see the industry's progress towards sustainability and look forward to contributing to this movement in my own way.
