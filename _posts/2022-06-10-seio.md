This week I had the opportunity to attend [**SEIO 2022**](https://seio2022.confereasy.com), the 39th Spanish Conference on Statistics and Operations Research, hosted in Granada from June 7–10. The event brought together researchers, professionals, and students from across Spain and beyond to exchange ideas on everything from stochastic modeling to public data, optimization, and applied decision-making.

I was there to present our work on [**UCA Datalab**](https://datalab.uca.es), the maritime route optimization platform developed at **UCA Datalab**. The project uses statistical models and real-time environmental data to improve the efficiency of shipping routes, cutting down on fuel usage, travel time, and emissions. It was great to bring this work into a conversation centered on **applied OR and sustainability**, and to connect with researchers exploring similar themes in logistics, transport, and energy systems.

The setting in Granada, complete with a visit to the Alhambra and a rooftop gala at Carmen de los Mártires, reminded us all how much we missed these in-person gatherings. Beyond the technical sessions, it was a pleasure to reconnect with old colleagues and meet new ones in the vibrant world of statistics and operations research.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
