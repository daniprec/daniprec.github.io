Hello dear readers,

I'm excited to share a highlight from this spring! On May 21st, we joined **Navalia 2024** in Vigo, one of Spain's most important gatherings for the shipbuilding and maritime industry.

We took the opportunity to bring along a group of talented **IE University students**, who joined us in pitching [**Green Navigation**](https://greenavigation.com) to an audience of shipbuilders, naval engineers, and industry leaders from across Spain. It was an energizing day of conversations, ideas, and cross-generational collaboration.

For our students, it was a chance to present a real-world innovation project on a national stage. And for us at Green Navigation, it was a privilege to exchange with professionals who understand the pressing need to modernize shipping practices. We showed how our platform uses environmental data and routing intelligence to support cleaner and more efficient maritime transport.

It's always a joy to blend education, research, and industry in meaningful ways. And Navalia was the perfect setting for that.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso, PhD
