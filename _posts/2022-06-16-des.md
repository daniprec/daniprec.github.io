This week I had the opportunity to participate in the **Digital Enterprise Show 2022** (DES), held in Málaga from June 14–16. The event brought together thousands of professionals in digital transformation, cybersecurity, AI, and industry 4.0. And we were proud to contribute from the maritime innovation front.

I presented **Smart Shipping**, our route optimization tool for more sustainable maritime transport. Built on oceanographic data and machine learning algorithms, the platform helps reduce emissions, fuel use, and transit time for cargo vessels. An example of how data science can directly support greener logistics.

Visitors had the chance to interact with live demos, discuss use cases, and explore how smart routing solutions can plug into broader digital infrastructure. It was inspiring to see how much momentum there is around open data, digital twins, and real-time decision-making, even in traditionally slower-moving sectors like shipping.

A big thank you to the **Junta de Andalucía** and the **Agencia Digital de Andalucía** for making Smart Shipping part of the #DES2022 showcase. And to **David Gómez-Ullate** (project lead), **Javier Jiménez**, and **Francisco Amor** for making it all possible. It's always energizing to present applied science in such a forward-thinking space.

All the best,

Daniel Precioso
