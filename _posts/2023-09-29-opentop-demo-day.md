Hello dear readers,

Yesterday was one for the books! The whole team made our way to *Opentop's Demo Day* in Valencia, where we presented [**Green Navigation**](https://greenavigation.com), our weather routing solution in front of industry leaders, investors, port authorities, and fellow entrepreneurs. It was the grand finale of Opentop's acceleration program, and what a ride it has been.

Standing on stage with my teammates (Javier Jiménez and David Gómez-Ullate) and joined by Carlos Redón and Mercedes from *Boluda Towage*, we had the pleasure to share the results of our very first pilot. Over the past few months, we've been working hand-in-hand with Boluda to simulate and optimize real tugboat routes using validated consumption models. The results are in: **we can cut GHG emissions by 10%** through intelligent weather routing.

This Demo Day wasn't just a pitch. It was a celebration of everything we've learned, built, and tested in a real-world maritime setting. And while it marked the end of our formal time in the program, it definitely doesn't mark the end of our collaboration. On the contrary, this is just the beginning of scaling our work to a much broader fleet and industry.

Massive thanks to our mentors and guides throughout this journey: Chema Leal, Guillermo Fernández, Jorge Marcos, Yolanda Trujillo, Thais Maria Glod, Víctor Collazos, and many more. Your insights, encouragement, and occasional reality checks were exactly what we needed.

And let's not forget the fantastic peer startups that made this program feel more like a family than a cohort: *Gandolapp, Sensing Tools,* and *DMS*. It was a joy to grow alongside you.

As I write this, I'm still buzzing with the energy of the event (or maybe it's the two espressos from the train ride home?). Either way, we're wrapping up this chapter proud, grateful, and laser-focused on what's next.

All the best,  

Daniel Precioso
