Hello dear readers,

I hope your spring is starting smoothly and you're finding time to both relax and stay curious. I'm happy to share that I recently participated in an episode of The Conversation Weekly, a podcast that brings together academic voices to explore pressing global issues.

In this episode, I was interviewed about my work on [Green Navigation](https://greenavigation.com), a weather routing platform that helps reduce maritime emissions by optimizing ship routes using wind, waves, and currents data. As I mentioned in the conversation, "We live in a world of information. The biggest challenge is knowing how to use it". That's precisely what we aim to do with Green Navigation: turn data into meaningful action.

The podcast explores the broader landscape of maritime decarbonization, from sail technologies to alternative fuels. Alongside me was Professor Alice Larkin from the University of Manchester, who offered valuable insights into the economic and environmental challenges of shifting the shipping industry away from fossil fuels.

This invitation follows our participation at [Prototypes for Humanity 2024 in Dubai](https://danielprecioso.com/posts/2024/dubai), where Green Navigation was showcased among 100 selected global innovations. It's encouraging to see continued interest in solutions that make shipping more sustainable.
