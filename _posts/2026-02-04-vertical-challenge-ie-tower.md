Hello dear readers,

Today I joined the **Vertical Challenge** at IE University. It is a stair race up the IE Tower. Nearly 450 people took part (students, faculty, staff, and friends). The track was advertised as 28 floors... but in reality they were close to 32. The first floors of the tower are TALL, because they include the auditorium. So yes, the race starts strong.

It was my first time participating, so I took it easy. I walked with my friends from the IE School of Science and Technology team. I finished in a little more than 10 minutes, and I am genuinely happy about it. The month of preparation paid off. I have been doing stair runs every morning when getting to work. Eight floors a day. And I will keep doing it. It is a great way to start the day and get some exercise!

Also, I got a medal (only for the top 500 finishers). Not Olympic gold, but it shines enough for me. Most important, I shared this experience with my IE community.

Keep pushing your limits, and remember: the only way to go is up!

All the best,

Daniel Precioso, PhD
