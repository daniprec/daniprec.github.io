Hello dear readers,

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve completed my doctoral thesis on Data Science and Machine Learning applied to the Blue Economy at Universidad de Cádiz, earning Cum Laude honors!

My thesis focused on sustainable fishing and weather routing, applying data science and Machine Learning to enhance efficiency and sustainability. The defense reunited past members of UCA Datalab, who I collaborated with in prior AI research in health, energy, and beyond. Some of my colleagues from Dalhousie University were also there, too!

A heartfelt thanks to my family, friends, and colleagues for their constant support, and to my thesis director, David Gómez-Ullate Oteiza, for his invaluable guidance.

As I celebrate this achievement, I look forward to applying my future efforts to drive positive change in the Blue Economy and Industry 4.0.

Thank you for being part of this journey!
