Hello again dear readers!

I am absolutely thrilled to share some exciting news with all of you today. After a journey of dedication, perseverance, and a passion for advancing sustainability in ocean-related industries, I am delighted to announce that I have successfully completed my doctoral thesis on Data Science and Machine Learning in the context of the Blue Economy at Universidad de Cádiz, earning Cum Laude honors!

The Blue Economy, a frontier of interdisciplinary study, aims to achieve sustainable utilization of ocean resources while preserving the environment's health. As we strive to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the significance of this field cannot be overstated. However, balancing economic growth with environmental conservation poses unique challenges, making the role of data science and Machine Learning all the more vital.

Throughout my thesis, I delved into the realms of sustainable fishing and weather routing, harnessing data science techniques to enhance efficiency and sustainability in both domains. By applying Machine Learning models, we gained valuable insights into monitoring fish populations, paving the way for informed and responsible fishing practices. Additionally, the implementation of weather routing tools optimized maritime transport, promoting fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

I am proud to share that my thesis was not only recognized for its academic excellence but also for its relevance to real-world industrial applications. It was a truly international endeavor, with contributions from esteemed collaborators and experts from Dalhousie University.

After my defense, I was particularly happy to see the past members of UCA Datalab reunited once again. Together with them, I conducted numerous impactful research projects at Cádiz University. Apart from the Blue Economy, we also explored areas related to health and energy, further broadening our understanding of how data science can contribute to a more sustainable and brighter future.

None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support of my incredible family, friends, and colleagues. Your presence and encouragement have been a constant source of motivation, and I am deeply grateful for your unwavering belief in my abilities.

A special thank you goes to my esteemed thesis director, David Gómez-Ullate Oteiza, whose guidance and mentorship have been invaluable throughout these years.

As I celebrate this milestone, I look ahead with excitement and determination. The knowledge and insights gained from this thesis will undoubtedly fuel my passion for promoting sustainability and driving positive change in the Blue Economy, as well as in other vital areas of research.

Thank you for being part of this incredible journey, dear readers! Your support has made this achievement even more meaningful.

Wishing you all a fantastic day ahead!
