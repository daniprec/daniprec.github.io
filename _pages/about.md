Welcome to my website! I am Daniel Precioso, a data scientist and predoctoral researcher at [UCA](https://www.uca.es/). My current research focuses on the many applications of Machine Learning in industry. This covers many fields, such as time series, optimization and computer vision. I encourage you to take a look at my [papers](https://daniprec.github.io/papers/) and [posts](https://daniprec.github.io/posts/) to know about the projects I am enrolled in! My PhD is done under the supervision of [David GÃ³mez-Ullate](http://datalab.uca.es/team/david/). Previously, I did a degree in Physics at [UCM](https://www.ucm.es/) and a MSc in Data Science at [UPM](https://www.upm.es/).
